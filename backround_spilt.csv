95,A plethora of work has demonstrated that it is easy to find or synthesize inputs for which a neural network is highly confident yet wrong.,BACKGROUND
96,"Generative models are widely viewed to be robust to such mistaken confidence as modeling the density of the input features can be used to detect novel, out-of-distribution inputs.",BACKGROUND
113,Such predictions suffer from the huge number of brain regions sampled on the voxel grid of standard fMRI data sets: the curse of dimensionality.,BACKGROUND

228,"While machine learning approaches to image restoration offer great promise, current methods risk training models fixated on performing well only for image corruption of a particular level of difficulty---such as a certain level of noise or blur.",BACKGROUND
233,"We consider a network of prosumers involved in peer-to-peer energy exchanges, with differentiation price preferences on the trades with their neighbors, and we analyze two market designs: (i) a centralized market, used as a benchmark, where a global market operator optimizes the flows (trades) between the nodes, local demand and flexibility activation to maximize the system overall social welfare; (ii) a distributed peer-to-peer market design where prosumers in local energy communities optimize selfishly their trades, demand, and flexibility activation.",BACKGROUND
240,One important factor determining the computational complexity of evaluating a probabilistic network is the cardinality of the state spaces of the nodes.,BACKGROUND

647,"In particular, models with factorized parameters (e.g.",BACKGROUND
648,Factorization Machines) and sparse learning algorithms (e.g.,BACKGROUND

686,"During the life span of large software projects, developers often apply the same code changes to different code locations in slight variations.",BACKGROUND
687,"Since the application of these changes to all locations is time-consuming and error-prone, tools exist that learn change patterns from input examples, search for possible pattern applications, and generate corresponding recommendations.",BACKGROUND
688,"In many cases, the generated recommendations are syntactically or semantically wrong due to code movements in the input examples.",BACKGROUND
689,"Thus, they are of low accuracy and developers cannot directly copy them into their projects without adjustments.",BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES

716,Geometric model fitting is a fundamental task in computer graphics and computer vision.,BACKGROUND
717,"However, most geometric model fitting methods are unable to fit an arbitrary geometric model (e.g. a surface with holes) to incomplete data, due to that the similarity metrics used in these methods are unable to measure the rigid partial similarity between arbitrary models.",BACKGROUND

39357,"Among many possibilities, Mean Average Precision(mAP) has emerged as the dominant performance metric for hashing-based retrieval.",BACKGROUND

39474,The most efficient algorithms for finding maximum independent sets in both theory and practice use reduction rules to obtain a much smaller problem instance called a kernel.,BACKGROUND
39475,The kernel can then be solved quickly using exact or heuristic algorithms - or by repeatedly kernelizing recursively in the branch-and-reduce paradigm.,BACKGROUND

46777,The effects of molecularly targeted drug perturbations on cellular activities and fates are difficult to predict using intuition alone because of the complex behaviors of cellular regulatory networks.,BACKGROUND
46778,An approach to overcoming this problem is to develop mathematical models for predicting drug effects.,BACKGROUND/RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS
46779,Such an approach beckons for co-development of computational methods for extracting insights useful for guiding therapy selection and optimizing drug scheduling.,BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES/METHODS/RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS
46780,"Here, we present and evaluate a generalizable strategy for identifying drug dosing schedules that minimize the amount of drug needed to achieve sustained suppression or elevation of an important cellular activity/process, the recycling of cytoplasmic contents through (macro)autophagy.",BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES/METHODS/RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS
46781,Therapeutic targeting of autophagy is currently being evaluated in diverse clinical trials but without the benefit of a control engineering perspective.,BACKGROUND
46791,Deep Neural Networks are powerful models that attained remarkable results on a variety of tasks.,BACKGROUND
46792,These models are shown to be extremely efficient when training and test data are drawn from the same distribution.,BACKGROUND
46793,"However, it is not clear how a network will act when it is fed with an out-of-distribution example.",BACKGROUND
46800,The number of optimization techniques in the combinatorial domain is large and diversified.,BACKGROUND
46801,"Nevertheless, real-world based benchmarks for testing algorithms are few.",BACKGROUND
46807,"Based on diffusion MRI data, tractography is the starting point for many methods to study brain connectivity.",BACKGROUND
46808,"Of the available methods to perform tractography, most reconstruct a finite set of streamlines, or 3D curves, representing probable connections between anatomical regions, yet relatively little is known about how the sampling of this set of streamlines affects downstream results, and how exhaustive the sampling should be.",BACKGROUND
46820,Women are dramatically underrepresented in computer science at all levels in academia and account for just 15% of tenure-track faculty.,BACKGROUND
46821,Understanding the causes of this gender imbalance would inform both policies intended to rectify it and employment decisions by departments and individuals.,BACKGROUND
46822,"Progress in this direction, however, is complicated by the complexity and decentralized nature of faculty hiring and the non-independence of hires.",BACKGROUND
46832,"We have witnessed the discovery of many techniques for network representation learning in recent years, ranging from encoding the context in random walks to embedding the lower order connections, to finding latent space representations with auto-encoders.",BACKGROUND
46833,"However, existing techniques are looking mostly into the local structures in a network, while higher-level properties such as global community structures are often neglected.",BACKGROUND
46839,State-of-the-art slot filling models for goal-oriented human/machine conversational language understanding systems rely on deep learning methods.,BACKGROUND
46845,Real-time semantic segmentation plays an important role in practical applications such as self-driving and robots.,BACKGROUND
46858,Compute-and-forward (CAF) relaying is effective to increase bandwidth efficiency of wireless two-way relay channels.,BACKGROUND
46859,"In a CAF scheme, a relay is designed to decode a linear combination composed of transmitted messages from other terminals or relays.",BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES
46860,Design for error-correcting codes and its decoding algorithms suitable for CAF relaying schemes remain as an important issue to be studied.,BACKGROUND
